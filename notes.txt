TODO:

    1. 
        trap detection -- webpages with queries (see solutions below)
        use text similartity algorithm on tokens
        can use temporary blacklist?
        
            use a dictionary of urls as keys (no query)
                value = list of tokens / counter
                
                when the counter reaches the threshold, stop crawling urls that that with the key
        
        text-similarity
            function of two lists
                 return a float (0-1)

    2.
        function - takes page url for each page
        keep track of list of subdomains (use urlparse netloc)
            number of unique pages in each subdomain (ordered by freq / alpha )
    
    3.
        blacklist
           low information pages
           pages that dont return status 200


SOLUTIONS: 

    traps:
        issue with same webpage with different query parameters (see examples below)
            sort queries when crawling to make unique urls (since the order of the queries does not matter)
            check similarity of all pages with query. if there is not much difference between other query urls on page - blacklist all query urls on that webpage.
            or limit number of times a url can be visited without the query
        
        url patterns:
            - ex: repeating directory/pattern (see examples below)
            - find a way to avoid using a pattern or directory depth limit
            - filter non webpage urls. EX. PDF,CSS
        and/OR text similarity 
            - compare to previous page
            - links inside a similar page will not be crawled

        blacklist - 
            avoid bad links: 
                avoid some code - 404?
                avoid empty responses
                avoid "low information value page"
                    ex: 1. ratio number of tags vs number of tokens
                        2. frequency of tokens that are real words (more processing)
            avoid traps

        improve is_valid, 
    
    robots.txt - 
        blacklist disallowed (temporary blacklist)
            note: blacklist should be a pattern
        
        sitemap - 
                crawl sitemap in addition to subdomain index page if it exists
                
                pseudo code:
                
                when a new subdomain is found, 
                    add subdomain home page to list?

                    if robots.txt exists and it includes a sitemap
                        if the sitemap is xml
                            add the sitemap url to the list
                        if the sitemap is txt
                            add all the urls in the txt file to the list
                
                note: will need to sleep for robots.txt / sitemap.txt for politeness
                
                
                
                can use for freshness (not needed) 
                    if the sitemap isnt kept up to date, check the actual website instead
